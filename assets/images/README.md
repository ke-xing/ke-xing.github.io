# Profile Image

This directory is where you should place your profile image and other images used throughout the website.

## Required Images

- `profile.jpg` - Your profile picture (recommended size: 500x500 pixels, square aspect ratio)
- `project1.jpg`, `project2.jpg`, etc. - Images for your featured projects

## Image Guidelines

- Use high-quality, professional images
- Optimize images for web (compress them to reduce file size)
- Maintain consistent aspect ratios for similar image types
- Consider using a professional headshot for your profile picture

You can replace any of the placeholder images with your own images while maintaining the same filenames to ensure the website displays correctly.
